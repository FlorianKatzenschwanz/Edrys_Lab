# lab-stm-data via Audio
Laboratories for the course "Software Development for Embedded Systems" at the TU Freiberg, demonstrating the use of DMA on an STM32 controller.


## Board
The laboratories were designed for the [STM32F413](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f413zh.html).


## Station
To host a station, there are two options:

- **Local (less secure)**  
  You can install the server locally by following the instructions in the [module-pyxtermjs](https://github.com/edrys-labs/module-pyxtermjs).

Once the terminal server is running you can add the station by deploying the laboratory and clicking the link under Settings > Station.
